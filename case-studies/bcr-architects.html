						<h2>Craft CMS Integration</h2>
						<p>We integrated the new website into Craft CMS, which has proven repeatedly to be a favourite among many of our clients due to its clean and user friendly interface.</p>


						<h2>Hand Crafted SVG Animations</h2>
						<p>BCR Infinity Architects used an internal designer to create a compelling illustrated graphic for the new website homepage. The idea of the graphic was to act as a landscape representation of the different architectural projects BCR have worked on and also allow website users to interact and click on various buildings to take them to a case study profile.</p>

						<img src="images/bcr.jpg" alt="">
						<p>As with any animated, interactive element we work on, Chameleon began with a detailed planning phase- to map out step by step what the animation needs to do when the website is loaded, what parts of the animated element are clickable, and which areas have ongoing animations.</p>

						<p>We divided the homepage animation up into a series of layers- which would slide up and fade in on page load, and defined some clickable “hot spots”.</p>

						<p>Once the planning and discussion phase was completed, the illustration was neatly organised within illustrator- giving each layer a unique ID name, and removing any unnecessary “bloat” - in order to ensure fast page loading speeds and smaller file sizes.</p>

						<p>The first task with the animation was to get the layers in place and have them animated in- one at a time. CSS transforms and animations were used to transition each layer in one at a time, before adding in the graphical elements.</p>

						<p>Using SVG shapes, the various central axis points and coordinates were then manually plotted, to then achieve “to and from” animated elements. In our case- we added spinning wind turbines, moving cranes and a moving tractor- using the native SVG animate element.</p>

						<p>Finally, various buildings were then linked to case studies, using XLINK inside the SVG.</p>
