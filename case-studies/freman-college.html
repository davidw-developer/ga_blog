				<h1 class="page-header__title">Freman College Case Study.</h1>
				<p class="page-header__sumary">In March 2017, I was tasked with building the brand new Freman College website. Following on from other successful projects such as Lucy Cavendish College, I have found over the years that education based websites have been some of my favourite projects to work on.</p>

			<p>With Freman College having a target audience of both parents and students, the approach I wanted to take was to build a website which portrayed a comfortable middle ground between "Robust" and "Progressive".</p>

			<p>Therefore, I built the underlying website structure to be as robust and browser friendly as possible- but added a layer of interesting animations and effects on top of this which would be available to modern browsers.</p>
