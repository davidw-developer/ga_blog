			<p class="page-header__sumary">The Whale Watching Handbook as the name implies is a storehouse of information about different species of Whales. An immensely fun project to work on, this website is very data heavy, making use of all types of media that the web can offer- from text, video, audio, galleries to interactive maps and infographics.</p>

		<p>I built the Front End of the website and integrated the project into Craft CMS between January and April 2018. As with other projects, I took the initiative of adding some creative touches such as the loading sequence animations and background images that “move” with the cursor, all of which the client was delighted with.</p>

		<p>Myself and the team worked very closely with the client, guiding them step by step through the process. We had some wonderful feedback when the clients presented the new website to an audience who is said to have been very impressed!</p>
