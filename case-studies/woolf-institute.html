				<h1 class="page-header__title">Woolf Institute Case Study.</h1>
				<p class="page-header__sumary">The Woolf Institute approached Chameleon for a brand new website which would launch in conjunction with their move to an impressive new premises on Madingley Road in Cambridge.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The impressive design is brought to life with different coloured sections and an array of creative CSS Animations which I added throughout the build process. Buttery smooth drop down menus, rotating geometric shapes, loading sequences and download icons which move on hover are just a few of the ideas. </p>

			<p>The Woolf Institute was a pleasure to build, and great clients to work with. At the end of the project, myself along with the Chameleon team were treated to a tour of their brand new building.</p>

			<h2>Positive Client Feedback</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"We commissioned Chameleon Studios to create a new website which reflects the Instituteâ€™s unique position as a bridge and a link between academic and public/professional-facing research and interfaith initiatives. Chas and Garth were professional and innovative in their planning and completion of a challenging brief. Right from the start, they understood what we are about and what we wanted! They were always on hand to answer queries. We were really impressed with their patience & work ethic and their attention to detail. We would highly recommend Chameleon Studios!"</p>
