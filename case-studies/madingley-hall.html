		<h1>Madingley Hall Case Study.</h1>
		<p>A classic, functional design given a modern touch- Madingley Hall is a website which is focussed on showcasing its highly impressive premises and encouraging visitors to book a table for dining or organise an event.</p>

		<img src="images/madingley.jpg" alt="">

		<p>The website was built entirely using Flexbox, and is powered by Craft CMS. I was responsible for providing an instructional demo to the client on how to use the Content Management System. </p>

		<p>The website was received very well by the client who was and continues to be a pleasure to work with.</p>
