		<p class="page-header__sumary">From late 2018 to present (January 2019), I was tasked with hand coding a number of email templates for Domino printing. These email templates ranged from standard marketing emails, to internal newsletters. Domino used an online email marketing automation tool called salesforce pardot.</p>
	</div>

	<p>I learned how to integrate email templates into pardot to create editable 'regions' and setup new campaigns.</p>

	<p>During the process of hand coding email templates, I learned about the many quirks of older email clients (Outlook 2007!).</p>

	<p>In order to help Domino Printing utilise a more productive workflow, I suggested to them that we adopt
	an email framework, such as MJML or Foundation Emails (by Zurb).</p>

	<p>This had a number of benefits:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Code would be pre-tested to help support older email clients, which was important to Domino</li>
		<li>A framework would come with plenty of pre-existing documentation</li>
		<li>The code would be much more "portable" amoung various development teams that Domino decide to contract in future</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>I spent a number of hours developing a demo template in both MJML and Foundation- and met with Domino to report my findings. Domino chose MJML, and I am now in the process of building a number of "boilerplate" email templates, which will help Domino standardise their email marketing strategy moving forwards.</p>
